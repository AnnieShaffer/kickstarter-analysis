# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to advise Louise if she should continue her KickStarter campaign for her play *Fever* at this time based on the data from other KickStarter campaigns.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
#### Challenge One
My first challenge with this data occurred while completing the steps in the analysis of the Outcomes Based on Goals. The outcome did not populate the same as the example shown in the challenge because I used the column for "pledged" (Column E) instead of "goals" (Column D).
#### Challenge Two
Additionally I was not able to mirror the pivot table shown in Deliverable 1 Step 10. This caused great confusion and I was stuck on this step for quite a while until I read the next step, which did mirror my pivot table. This error may have occurred because I am using the newest version of Excel (Excel 2019) and the screenshots are from older versions of the program.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
  - One conclusion we can draw from the data regarding the launch date is that the greatest number of successful outcomes occur in May of  each year.
  - The second conclusion we can draw from this data set is that the number of successful and failed outcomes are almost equal in the month of December each year.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  - We can conclude that the KickStarter Campaigns that are more likely to be successful for theaters have a goal between $0 and $19999 and $35000 and $44999. However, the campaigns with higher goals have a much smaller sample size.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
  - Some of the limitations of this data set are that the population size of KickStarters decrease as the goals and pledges of the campaigns increase in dollar amount. This creates data that may be skewed as there is not as much data for these sets. Additionally, there are not an equal number KickStarters each year. This could leave out important data based on the economy at the time of the KickStarter. Campaigns closer to the Great Recession will have much different data than those in more recent years when economies have been much more stable.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
